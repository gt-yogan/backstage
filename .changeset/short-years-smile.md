'@backstage/plugin-catalog': patch
---

Added the ability to switch entity kind on the catalog index page. This is a non-breaking change, but if you created a custom `CatalogPage` and wish to use this feature, make the modifications shown on [#6895](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/6895).
